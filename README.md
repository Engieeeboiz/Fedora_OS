 ## INSTALLATION OF FEDORA

This document provides a detailed guide for installing Fedora OS on VMware Workstation. It begins with downloading and installing VMware and obtaining the official Fedora ISO from the Fedora Project website. The guide covers creating a virtual machine, allocating RAM and disk space, and selecting the appropriate installation settings. It then outlines the Fedora installation process, including configuring language, network, and user accounts. Finally, it explains how to reboot the system, remove the ISO file, and log in using the created credentials.

##systemcall

The document provides an overview of system calls in Fedora OS, with a specific focus on the sbrk() system call. This function is used to manage dynamic memory allocation by adjusting the program's data segment size, which is essential for low-level memory control in C programs. A sample C code snippet demonstrates the use of sbrk(), highlighting both successful memory allocation and proper error handling. Since Fedora is based on the standard Linux kernel, the behavior of sbrk() aligns with other Linux distributions. Overall, the document serves as a concise technical reference for understanding and using sbrk() in a Linux environment.
